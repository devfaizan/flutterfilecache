counterfilestorage

This app uses famous counter example and store value of counter in a file.<br>

### overview
To work with files first we need to use path_provider package and get path where file will be stored. Documents are usually stored in AppData for android.<br>
Now its time to create file with that path. Then we will make methods to write contents in file & to read them.<br>
It is better to use separate class to manipulate file.

On startup counter is zero, when increment button is tapped it will increment the counter as well as it will store counter value into file and the cycle goes on.
